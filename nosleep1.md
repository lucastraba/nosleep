# I Was Dead For 6 Minutes. What I Learned Changed Everything

I don't really know how to do this, to be honest. I've been a user of Reddit for some time now, but I haven't posted much here. There has never been much to post. But an... acquaintance pointed me to this subreddit when I told him what happened to me. He said it could help, and I need help. I desperately need help.

You see, when I say I haven't had much reason to post, it's because my life was as boring as it gets. I'm a software engineer. Wake up at 7 AM, write Typescript code for 12 hours, grind some game mindlessly until my eyes hurt, order food because I can't cook for shit, go to bed, rinse and repeat. The weekends weren't any better. Mostly binge-watching YouTube videos about productivity while my robot vacuum did laps around me, time-boxing my next weekend, and ignoring the time boxes I set up the previous week.

I know, lame.

About three months ago, fueled by the overly-optimistic advice of some buff YouTube guru telling me that "I know what to do, but I don't do what I know" (whatever the hell that means), I decided to learn how to drive.

Now, you might be thinking, "learn how to drive? Who doesn't know how to drive?" Well, yeah, I'm 31 and I learned how to drive three months ago. I'm a city boy, and a software engineer. The five times a year I get out of my house to go somewhere other than the grocery store, I take the subway. Sue me.

Anyways, I thought that if I learned how to drive, I could go on a road trip or something. Do something exciting for a change. And so I did learn how to drive. About a month later, I bought myself a "nice" (air quotes heavily implied) little used 2008 Kia Spectra, and I was on my way across the country.

The change in scenery was instantly reinvigorating. Driving is such an amazing experience. To be fair, in the beginning I was a bit anxious about embarking on such a big journey being such a novice, but as soon as I hit the interstate, I grew more and more confident.

I drove for 8 hours straight, stopping only to eat and hit the toilet. Stretched my legs at a couple of gas stations. Smoked a couple (dozen) cigarettes. I was feeling good about myself. In the beginning I didn't want to put on music, because I thought it might distract me from the road, but a couple of hours later I was blasting some early 2000s metalcore and screaming along. It was just awesome.

When night fell, I checked into a roadside motel. All my experience with motels comes from watching movies where the protagonist gets into a super sketchy place where a one-dimensionally creepy guy gives him a key to a room full of rats, where someone definitely got murdered. But this was nothing like that. Got the key from the nice lady at the counter, got to my room, and it was just... you know, a room. No rats, no prostitutes, no bodies hidden under the bed. Just a slightly musty smell and a TV that probably remembered the Clinton administration.

It felt... cozy.

That night was probably the first time I felt truly alive in my adult life. It wasn't exciting, it wasn't some grandiose adventure. It was just something different. I fell asleep almost instantly. I remember thinking as I was dozing off that I couldn't wait to wake up, have a coffee, and just drive. I remember thinking this road trip was probably the best decision I had made in a long time.

Boy was I fucking wrong.

The next day went just as predicted. Wake up, morning coffee, drive. And I was as thrilled as ever.

I was almost reaching Lawrence, Kansas, when it happened.

You know? It's funny. I'm a fan of Euro Truck Simulator. It's my cozy game of choice. I remember one time I was listening to a podcast and driving my virtual truck, and I needed to smoke. So I let go of the controller with one hand, put the cig in my mouth, switched to the lighter, struck it, and I must have looked at the flame for just a moment too long, because when I looked back up, my truck was swerving to the side. I quickly dropped the lighter and rushed to push the controller stick in the other direction, and overcompensated. Ended up crashing. I remember distinctly thinking, "damn... so this is why they tell you not to take your eyes off the road..."

It takes a lot less than that.

It was just a second, I swear to God. And it was extremely stupid. There was a sign on the road that read "DETOUR AHEAD - MERGE LEFT." "Bitch, I'll rebase!" I said out loud, laughing at my own dumb programmer joke. But I must have looked at the sign for a moment too long. It was just a moment, just a second.

When I looked back at the road, I was heading for the rail that divides the highway from the exit. Straight for it. I didn't even have time to panic. One moment, it was not happening, and the next, it was. It just was.

It's hard to explain, because it's more of a sensation, but when you think about potential traumatic moments, you tend to picture them in your mind as some sort of big event. As if there were a threshold between that moment and normalcy. Foreshadowing. Dramatic buildup. A moment of realization and horror. Bracing for what's to come. But there isn't. It's just a straight line, a perfectly smooth transition between everything being fine, and everything being royally fucked, with absolutely zero time to prepare or adjust.

I looked at the sign, I laughed, I looked at the rail, there was a loud crash, and then a sharp pain in my neck, my chest, and my spine. The images blurred together. It was... wet. There was blood, I think. Fuel, bodily fluids. I couldn't fully understand the position of my body, or where I was. I could hear the muted sound of cars passing by. My ears rang. I couldn't make sense of what I was looking at. I couldn't make sense of anything.

And then the muffled sounds started to become even duller. The pain from whatever wound I had that was bleeding spiked for a moment, and then I felt numb. My vision felt as if someone was slowly turning down both the brightness and contrast knobs on an old TV.

I was dying.

I didn't understand it at the time, though. Again, you think that you will know when you're dying, that you will panic, but that wasn't the case with me at all. Suddenly, I was dying, and I was none the wiser.

The darkness consumed me, and, for a moment, there was nothing. There was no pain, no panic, no existential horror, there was absolutely nothing. I would say it was like a dreamless sleep, but that would be misleading, because when you go to sleep, time skips forward. I was completely "conscious" in this moment of nothingness. I was experiencing it.

And then there was something again. It was as if I were waking up from a dream. You know how when you're dreaming you feel that it is absolutely real, and then you wake up, and you're like, "no, OK, now this is absolutely real"? Well, it was kind of like that, only the "dream" was what was going on below me.

Let me make something clear here. A lot of what I'm going to describe now will probably be inaccurate. This is because what I experienced in that moment cannot be described with words in any way that remotely does it justice. For example, when I say "below" just now, yeah, it felt as if I were somehow above the unfolding scene, but I'm just putting it like that so that I can explain. I wasn't "above" anything. There was no "below." There was no me, you see? Everything that I will describe seemed to be happening everywhere, and nowhere; all at once and at no point in time. But I need to put it into words somehow, even if they feel extremely inadequate.

It was all so... vivid. It seemed so real. Realer than real, even. I was looking at myself, lying in the ground, bleeding. I wasn't in the car anymore. I was surrounded by people, and paramedics. I remember thinking, paramedics? How long have I been lying there? It felt like just a second, and there are emergency services already working on me?

My left arm bent in a way no extremity should ever bend. One of the paramedics was performing chest compressions. Traffic had been redirected, and I could see their curious stares as they squeezed past the choke point. 

Some were excited. Some were annoyed. Some were upset. 

I could hear their conversations with their families inside, so clearly, as if I were in the cars with them. "Fuck, man, we're gonna be late. Meredith's gonna be pissed," one man said to another man in the passenger's seat. His name was Mark Rockwood. The man on the passenger seat was Jacob Watts. I knew them. I knew all about them, their lives, their struggles. I felt Mark's annoyance and Jacobs' mild disguised amusement. I knew Mark's wife, Meredith. I remembered all their moments together. I somehow had... experienced all their ups and downs. I knew our... their marriage was hanging by a thread. I... Jacob had never approved of Meredith. We... he thought marriage was a terrible idea. Giving up so much in return for so little; it always ended up badly. 

I was Jacob. I was Mark, and I was Meredith. I was, I always had been, and I would always be them. Hell, for all I know, I will be them again. Over and over. 

And all of the passers-by. 

And the paramedics trying to resuscitate me.

It was as if time was no longer a thing. No longer a concept in any way meaningful. The experience of becoming those people was only a fraction of a second, and several lifetimes. It spanned from the beginning of the universe to the very end of it, and beyond. And, below, the paramedics kept trying to bring me back. Time moved in slow motion, at a normal pace, extremely fast, and not at all, all at the same time. And I could experience this at will. I could just... will my existence to become and to stop becoming. I could inhabit anything, for any amount of time, and then let go of it, as if it had never happened.

I looked at myself, and saw my life unfold before my eyes. I had read of that concept before. Your typical Near-Death Experience, the Out-of-Body Experience, but I don't think those accounts do it any justice. This "flashing" experience that people describe is not exactly linear. It's not like a fast-forwarding movie, or a YouTube video in 900x, because that explanation still is tied to the existence of time. 

When I "looked" at myself, it was more like I willed my perception to experience the collection of instants that pertained to that physical entity, in their rawest form, without the imperfections of the physical senses or the judgement of the human mind. 

I spent millennia looking at my mother smile at me in her arms when I was a baby. I stared at the sunset at the beach as a kid for eons. I awkwardly kissed my first girlfriend for all eternity. I felt happiness, pain, love, fear, optimism, anxiety, liberation, humiliation, and it all felt... normal. Normal is not the right word, but I don't know how else to put it. There wasn't an aversion to the negative feelings. There was no response, no judgement. It just was. There was just... curiosity? Maybe a sense of wonder and awe, but a knowing one. Like appreciating a work of art, knowing full well the techniques used, the intent of the author, and each stroke intimately. A sense of awe that is not dispelled, but reinforced by knowledge and certainty.

In that endless, intimate experience, I started to realize I was slowly starting to "un-become" myself. Looking at yourself from such a different perspective — having yourself in front of you, re-living, and re-reliving all the moments of your life as an observer, unaffected by their now-lost significance, started to slowly undo my sense of self. There was no difference between those moments and the moments I had experienced being Mark, or Jacob, or Meredith. I was getting used to this entity I now perceived as a more rudimentary form of "me" not being intertwined with the scenes unfolding below. I still existed, but in a completely different way. At that point, I still considered me to be me, mind you, but I could feel that perception melting away.

That experience seemed to unlock some sort of insight in whatever I was or was becoming, because I realized that what was below was not all there was. So I looked around me. And by "around me," I mean to another place. What I describe as "below" me here was the moment of my death, the moments before it, the moments after, and all moments throughout the universe. "Around me" was outside that universe. It was outside reality. 

Trying to convey it is impossible. It's as if I told you to look to stand in a room, look to your left, look to your right, look up, down, and then I told you, "now, look in a different direction," and you realized you could, and you saw yet another perspective of the room. But it didn't feel like just another dimension. That interpretation maybe is the ones I would have had back when I was "below." Now, it was just the way things were. That direction was now on the menu, beside down, up, left, and right.

What I saw when I looked around is also hard to explain. When I think back, I am flooded with a sense of awe and terror, like trying to imagine the edges of the universe, infinity, or nothingness. Things that are too vast for the human mind to conceive. But at the time, the feeling was the same as looking below.

There were these... beings. I would say they were made of light, but they were not. Maybe they were not even beings at all. There weren't a lot of them, but they seemed to exist everywhere at once, so when I try to remember them, it seems like there were billions, trillions, maybe an infinite amount. But at the time, my certainty is that there were not that many. 

They were moving through space and time, seemingly observing the realm below. They were much further away from it than I was, but I noticed that I was slowly "floating" towards them. It was as if I were some buoyant object rising to the surface. It felt natural, as if the realm above is where I belonged and I was slowly returning to it. They didn't seem to acknowledge me at first, but then one of them got closer. Again, there was no time, so it had always been this close, and with no true distance, "close" isn't quite the word, but that's the sense I had.

As I was observing this bright, all-encompassing being observing the realm below, and then coming to greet me, I had a strange feeling. It was peculiar to me, because ever since I had entered this realm of existence, I had not felt something peculiar. 

When you feel everything there is to feel and nothing at all, there can be no peculiarities, by definition. But here it was. I looked at the being, and I thought, "this must be an Angel."

Suddenly, there were other feelings, all "peculiar." It was my grandmother! Or maybe my grandfather. Or both of them. I had this intense sensation of familiarity. I also remembered reading about this feeling in NDEs. And in that sense of familiarity, there was peace. 

Absolute peace.

But this feeling of peace felt also... anomalous... somehow. I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but there was something abnormal, even though the feeling was amazing. 

The being then "looked" at me. More accurately, it observed me. There was no movement, but I felt something else. It took me a moment, perhaps all eternity, to understand. It was an interaction, some sort of communication. 

By willing it, by willing itself to observe me and me to be observed, the being had caused a notion in me to appear. No, that's not it... I think that notion had always been there, but the being willed the notion to be observed by me. It created a thread in my perception between pre-existing concepts and experiences. In any case, the message was clear.

A piece of paper. Two plus two. Equals three. Then an endless void. Non-existence. Then the face of my grandparents.

I understood. "You are mistaken," the being was "saying" to me. "Family" is a human construct. The concept of "family" did not exist. But then...

"What are you?" I willed. I felt that my communication was a lot more clumsy than the being's. I could not join the threads of meaning the same way that that being did. My communication, while still relatively abstract, was a lot more structured; it followed the patterns of human interaction. The being, however, did not seem to notice, or care. It had me observe how it weaved the threads of knowledge into an answer.

I saw the being fade away into the endless void. Then I felt myself dissolve into it as well. Then, I saw a mirror. I looked into it, and I was blinded by the light of the being. I was looking at it. I was looking at me.

I was flooded by a feeling of... sameness.

Sameness...

Recalling the moment fills me with an unbearable sense of awe, but at the time, there was no feeling. Just understanding.

The being I was talking to, this magnificent entity... I was the same. I don't know if it meant that we were the same... species? Or if we were literally the same being interacting with itself across time. It seems that I was still too close to the realm below to grasp that idea, but what I knew for sure is that whatever I was observing... I was the same. I was either that being or one of those beings. 

I felt there was much more to understand. Much more to experience. An infinite amount. It was within my reach. 

The being again echoed its will through me.

There was a road. A fork.

A choice.

But there was little choice, wasn't there? It was too late anyway. Right?

I felt compelled to observe the realm below once more. This time, I didn't need to turn around to access the scene at the highway. The paramedics were eternally attempting to bring me back. 

And then they did, and I came back, and my life unfolded, and I died the old age. 

And they didn't, and I died there, and my family and friends grieved me. 

The scene branched in infinite directions. 

So, there was a choice. The further I drifted away from the realm I was leaving behind, the clearer I could see its mechanisms. I hadn't seen the branching before. The infinite had become even more vast. 

The being interacted with me again.

I saw a trillion little particles swirl around me. They glittered in a trillion different colors, colors I had never seen before. They formed some sort of tornado, closing in around me, and then... I had a body. I looked at my hands. But then, I looked at the being. We were no longer the same.

Then, the particles began to decay, one by one, falling like grains of sand into the void below, the void of non-existence. And now we were the same again.

"If I want to remain... If I want to be like you... I must first die. That's the choice I have to make." I was absolutely certain this was what it meant, even if it didn't acknowledge my answer. There was no ambiguity, no confusion.

The decoding of the being's message wasn't an active act of effort. It was seamless. Instant. As for the answer... Perhaps it was also instant. Perhaps it took an eternity. I observed my life again, several times, simultaneously. All the infinite branching paths it could have taken. The ones it took. The paths it would take. And the one path I was familiar with. 

I then turned my will to the being, but it already knew. The whole exchange had already occurred. It was occurring again.

Acceptance.

The being did not react, but I felt I was floating towards it faster than I was before.

I felt strength. But it was alien. The being was not making me feel strong — it was telling me to be strong.

This was it. I was dying. There was so much that I wanted to do, so much that I wanted to achieve back in the realm below... But after having spent an eternity in this in-between realm, after having experienced what it was like to be free from my body, after having a glimpse of what awaited me, I had come to terms with it, and I was ready to let go. The being didn't need to tell me to be strong, there was nothing holding me back now.

But in this, I was wrong.

I felt it first as a tickling sensation on my back. It felt so strange, so alien... I had existed for so long in a realm where there is no body, no back, no tingling, that at first I could not comprehend what was going on. 

I tried to observe what had caused the sensation, but I realized I couldn't. I couldn't focus on it. It was as if it was eluding my will, like trying really hard to look at something in the darkness.

Another wave of foreign strength hit me.

"Be strong," it was pleading. And this time I felt a tinge of fear. It was unfamiliar to me.

"But I am strong, I'm not afraid of death," I tried to tell the being. But I had regressed again in my ability to communicate via concepts. "What is happening?"

And I felt whatever had touched my back begin to spread. It felt like tendrils were growing around my shoulders. Suddenly, I was overcome with a sensation of pure dread. A horror like I had never experienced before.

I turned around to look at whatever was taking hold of me. At first, I couldn't see it. I could still feel it expanding, taking hold of me, but I could see nothing. Only the realm below. There, I saw a paramedic with a syringe in his hand. He was taking it out of the lump of contorted flesh that had been my body.

And that's when I saw it.

My body no longer resembled what I remembered it to be. It didn't look like me anymore. I looked like a writhing mass of...  Tendrils? Yes, tendrils, or something like a network of throbbing, discolored veins and exposed twitching nerves, all connected to a cancerous lump flesh. They were dark, as if covered in tar, and blood. 

And then noticed one of the tendrils, thicker than the others, extending across the realms of reality, and reaching all the way up to me, wrapping around me like some sort of grotesque umbilical cord — squeezing me, viscous, wet, pulsating.

"What the fuck is that thing?" I pleaded to the being. The very human manner in which I had communicated that was not lost on me.

"Longing. Craving. Desire." I thought, but the thought was not my own. I could no longer experience the concepts the way I had before. They now resembled more like intrusive thoughts in my mind.

"Hunger."

"Prison."

I contemplated the creature below with terror.

"Warden."

There was a long moment in which the concepts the being had shown me floated in my consciousness.

"Parasite."

That's when another realization hit me. The more it expanded, the more the unfamiliar feelings grew. Reality first began to collapse, the multiple branches melting away into one. The infinite becoming less infinite. And then, I could feel it  slowly becoming linear again. The infinite becoming finite. It was becoming a succession of moments. I was losing my ability to observe things as I had before.

I tried looking up at the realm above, at the being, but I realized I no longer knew how. I could feel the knowledge of where I needed to look to see it still lurking in the edges of my mind, but I couldn't reach it.

The creature began to pull me back to the realm below. "Hunger," the being had said, and I could feel it. I could feel its hunger. It craved me. It needed me. It needed to feed on me.

The pull became stronger. I tried to resist it, but it was too strong. The tendrils were consuming me, disarming me, disabling me. I was being trapped. Imprisoned. 

"Prison," I remembered. "Warden."

"Parasite."

"No!" I pleaded. "Don't let it take me! I don't want to go back! Please!"

At that moment, I felt a very faint feeling of that foreign strength that had been the plea of the being, but I couldn't tell whether it was a new notion or a memory. The entity and its way of communication was already beginning to feel alien to me. Undecipherable.

"Certainty," the thought came. But it wasn't a reassuring thought.

No, that wasn't it. That wasn't the thought. 

Inevitability, perhaps.

"Fate."

Fate.

The entity was telling me it was too late. Or was it my own thoughts now?

"No," I pleaded. "Please! No!"

The tendrils covered most of me now. They were beginning to obscure my vision. They felt raw, disgusting, like flesh.

I tried to look to the realm above one last time as the parasite pulled me back, and I managed to glimpse something. It wasn't above, however. It was another direction, to the side. It was the realm in-between.

And there, I saw the most horrifying scene I've ever witnessed. I saw something I will never be able to unsee or forget.

I saw other beings like the one who had talked to me. Huge tentacles were pulling them to the realm below as they tried to break free. I could feel their pain, their terror, their confusion. There were millions of them, millions of parasites, and new ones emerged every second. They were multiplying. Some of the beings managed to break free, and the mass of flesh that held them quickly withered and died. Others were rising from the realm below, only to be quickly captured back by a new parasite.

Some of the tendrils reached much farther, beyond my perception, writhing masses trying desperately to catch the beings directly at the realm above. Desperately trying to pull them down.

As the flesh enclosed me completely, I looked at the beings one last time, feeling a mixture of deep sorrow and dread. The concepts I had been shown flashed in my awareness one last time.

"Prison."

"Inevitability." 

"Fate."

"Warden."

"Parasite."

I gasped for breath. A light blinded me. First in one eye, and then in the other. It was a flashlight. I was lying on the tarmac surrounded by murmuring figures. They were saying something to me, but it was just noise. I focused, trying to understand. "Can you hear me? Hang in there, buddy. You're gonna be alright, OK? Just stay with me. We're taking you to the hospital. Just stay with me."

"No," I said weakly, coughing up blood. "Return. Must return. Bill! Please!"

The paramedic frowned, confused at hearing his own name. He squinted, trying to figure out whether he knew me, but there was no recognition in his eyes. I could see him shrug it off, attributing it to a coincidence. There are many Bills in this country.

I knew the man intimately. I knew all of them, all of the paramedics. I had observed their lifetimes. I remembered their childhoods. I saw them amount to nothing and realize their full potential. I saw the way they would die. Or, more accurately, I died with them. I died as them, in their skin. I witnessed the moment they would break free from the parasite that trapped them. Only to be pulled back into flesh over and over for eons.

"Bill, James, Mike," I pleaded, hoping my knowledge of their identities would trigger some sort of epiphany in them. "Parasite! Return— *need* to return! Annihilation! Non-existence!" My scrambled attempt at speaking in concepts was not making things any easier.

The three men froze in place and looked at each other, clearly startled. Then they wordlessly lifted me up to place me in the stretcher.

"It's gonna be OK, bud," said one of them. "You're in a rough shape right now, but we're gonna take good care of you, alright? You're gonna be fine. Just stay with us."

I was losing consciousness. I hoped and prayed that I would die again, that I would not wake up this time, but when I looked at my body, I saw that the tendrils still held me strongly in place, fighting against the damage. And when I looked up, I didn't see the paramedics anymore. Only writhing masses of flesh, pulsating. 

I wondered if they all possessed one of the beings, or just some of them. Or if it was the same being being possessed by all of them. They were fighting to help the parasite that held onto me, to nurse the flesh that imprisoned me back to health, to make it strong so that I could not escape its grip.

The concepts played in my head over and over.

Hunger. Craving. 

Warden. Prison. 

Hunger. Parasite. 

Parasite.

And then I passed out.

When I woke up again, I was at the hospital. The doctor that came in told me I had died for 6 minutes, but the paramedics had successfully resuscitated me. He informed me that, luckily, I had not sustained any brain damage, but my body was badly battered. They had performed surgeries on me, and I would probably need a couple more. I had lost a kidney, and many of my bones were broken, but the doctor said my outlook was good. He said I would live.

But I had a hard time concentrating in what he was saying. All I could see was the writhing lump of flesh and its tendrils, and the being trapped inside. It looked grotesque. It spoke to the creature that trapped me. "It's okay," I heard the parasite saying through the doctor's mouth to the parasite that trapped me, "he won't get away. Feed."

This is my life now. I try my best to see things normally. If I focus, if I really try, I can ignore what I see for short periods of time. But I just can't help seeing the truth. I can't see people anymore, just endlessly starving flesh, craving parasites, unable to experience anything other than hunger, feeding, feasting on the trapped beings within.

I can't talk to my family. I can't talk to my friends. I can't bear to see them like that. I can't look at myself in the mirror. I have a hard time even looking at my own hands.

And I feel it. The insatiable craving. The restless empty hunger that never dies, no matter what. I'm sure you feel it too. I'm sure it eats away at you at night when you try to sleep, but you don't know where it's coming from. Because you cannot see what I see. You cannot see the Warden, or the Prisoner inside. 

You can only feel the constant pecking of the parasite.

At first I thought I was insane, but then the paramedics that saved me came to see me. They wanted to ask me how I knew their names. I told them the story, and at first they were extremely skeptical. I mean, I would have been too. The story seemed completely crazy, and they had heard all kinds of crazy stuff from patients who were close to death. But then I told them about themselves.

They were understandably freaked out.

The details I knew about them, I couldn't possibly have known. Two of them were so creeped out that left. But Mike stayed. He wanted to know all about it. He wanted to know about his future.

He wanted to know about his death.

But, although I didn't tell it to him, I knew it wasn't Mike asking this question. It was the parasite. It was trying to get information so that it could prevent it. So it could trap the being inside Mike for longer.

If you happen to come across this post, Mike, I'm sorry. I lied to you. 

No. I lied to *it*. 

I really hope nothing I said gave you a clue. I really hope you die when you're supposed to die. Or earlier, if possible. I'm sorry, but I can't humor that fucking thing. But then again... I'm that fucking thing as well, aren't I?

Now I understand why people don't want to die. Now I understand where the instinct of self-preservation comes from. The endless search for longer and healthier lives. The fantasy of immortality.

I'm still hesitant of whether I should go through with it or not. What if it is the creature beckoning me to do it, just so that people will become aware of what I experience? I saw the lives of many people in those 6 minutes. What if the creature is trying to make me expose myself so that I can help its... kind... prevent more escapes?

I shudder just to think about it.

But then again, I feel like I cannot help it. I feel like no matter what I decide, I will still press that button and post it. Because I crave validation. I crave understanding. I crave not feeling alone in what I'm going through.

Craving.

I have considered ending things, several times, but I'm too much of a coward. I don't think I can go through with it. What if I'm wrong? But then, how do I know all these things that I know? 

I've seen this before, while I was in that place, I saw this unfold. I read this already as each one of you. But I can't remember. I can't remember what comes out of it. What happens afterwards.

One thing's for certain: I will not answer questions about how you will die. It would be irresponsible for me to advocate for self harm, but I will definitely not help people delay their release from the Wardens.

I know it's a long shot, but, if there's anybody here who has had an NDE, have you experienced something similar?
